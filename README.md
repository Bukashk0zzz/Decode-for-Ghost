Decode is designed to take advantage of the unique features that Ghost has to offer while providing a beautiful and responsive design. Decode looks modern and minimal across all device types with it's refined responsive design. Decode also includes an author card at the bottom of each post page as a simple way to credit the author and link to his or her website.

Decode does not have any theme-specific settings currently, but the changes you make to blog settings will take effect in Decode.
